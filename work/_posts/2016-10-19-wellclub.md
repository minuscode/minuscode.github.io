desc: "We've helped a Minnesotan startup build an app/platform for physical rehabilitation connecting therapists and patients featuring motion device integration for the prescribed exercises.
This is a startup we've helped build from zero, going through various iterations of their product since mid 2014.
I'm especially proud of this project because it allowed us to create a product that contributes to improving life quality and help in a time of need. We've contributed not only with the tech but on a product design role as well by helping shape it.
We have a Ruby on Rails app powering the various layers of the Back-office that serve organisations/clinics/physicians and also the API that powers the application."
